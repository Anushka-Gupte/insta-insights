# Insta-Insights — Instagram User Segmentation

Insta-Insights performs user segmentation for Instagram audiences using machine learning clustering. It segments users based on two core behavioral features — Visit Score and Spending Rank — and exposes a Streamlit dashboard that visualizes cluster scatter plots, per-cluster metrics (count, percentage, average Visit Score, average Spending Rank), assigns a descriptive category to each cluster, and provides actionable recommendations for marketing / business teams.
